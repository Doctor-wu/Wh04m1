> "The Doctor will see you now."

Hey, I am Doctor Wu, an open source enthusiast.<br>

Working at {Moego|https://github.com/MoeGolibrary}<br>
Core team member of {VueUse|https://github.com/vueuse/vueuse}, Collaborator of {Vue Vapor|https://github.com/vuejs/core-vapor}<br>
Recently contributing on {Vue Core|https://github.com/vuejs/core} and {Vue Vapor|https://github.com/vuejs/core-vapor}

I would like you to just call me Doctor<span i-openmoji:tardis op75 />, maybe I will write a blog to explain it in the future.

The beginning of my involvement with OSS was when I started to contribute on {VueUse|https://github.com/vueuse/vueuse}, I found it was a cool repo since it collect so many useful Vue Composition API utilities. I think that will be cool if I can somehow contribute to it. So I started attempt to write some utilities and fix some bugs of it. After some days, I was surprised that &nbsp;<PeopleWithAvatar

 name="Anthony Fu"
 avatarUrl="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11247099"
/> invited me to join the core team of VueUse. That's inspired me so much, and that somehow guided me to the path of OSS.

Outside of programming, I like to play basketball, watch movies, and sing karaoke, if you happen to be in the same city (Currently is <span i-material-symbols:location-on-outline />Shenzhen) as me, let's hang out together! As a side-note, I'm Gen-Z and my MBTI type is ESFJ-A.
